<h3><b>What is legislation?</b></h3>
<p>Legislation is one of the most effective ways for students to voice their concerns to the administration and enact change within the college. Any student within the college can write pieces of legislation detailing an initiative with college-wide impact in what is called a resolution. NSC also produces bills, which amend the internal structure of council. Notable examples of NSC legislation include an interdisciplinary degree initiative that culminated in the creation of the BSA as well as work-in-progress initiatives to create minors in CNS and a mobile app for CNS students.</p>
