<h3><b>About Us</b></h3>
<p>The Student/Faculty committee plays an important role in fostering the relationships between UT students, faculty, and staff. This is in part to the many events we organize and put on, whether they be luncheons, mixers, or our spin on Faculty Appreciation Week in which CNS students write thank you notes to influential faculty and staff.<br>The events the student faculty committee put on are meant to mutually benefit the faculty and the students by forming relationships that would otherwise be difficult at such a large university. These relationships often grow and lead to other great opportunities!</p>
