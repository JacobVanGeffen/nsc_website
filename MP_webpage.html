<h3><b>About Us</b></h3>
<p>Multimedia &amp; Press is the committee that oversees Natural Sciences Council’s print and social media presence. We design and create nearly all of the advertising material used for NSC events and maintain Council’s Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn pages.  In addition, Multimedia &amp; Press hosts events that foster relationships between our council and other councils in the university, and between council members and College of Natural Sciences organizations.</p>
