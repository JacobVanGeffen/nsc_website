<h3><b>About Us</b></h3>
<p>The Internal Relations Committee serves to bring the council together to form a close knit family. We plan and lead a multitude of social events throughout the year that help the members of our council become long lasting friends. We also plan events between other councils and organizations to spread our ideas and our camaraderie and friendship across the college and the university. If you are creative, want to have fun, and love helping people make connections while also making those connections yourself, then Internal Relations is for you!</p>

			<h4>Intramural Softball</h4>
			<p>We joined together NSC members of all different softball skill levels to play IM Softball. We won our first game 7-4 and plan to keep hitting it out of the park. Come cheer us on or join us for our various other IM sports that we play each semester.</p>

			<h4>Lunch Buddies</h4>
			<p>Every Friday, the members of NSC gather to grab lunch together with a member of the Internal Relations Committee. We usually meet on campus and all walk together to a nearby restaurant. Bonding over a meal is the best type of bonding, after all.</p>

<p>The new and old members came together for their first group social event. We had pizza and cookies delivered and played intense games of ultimate frisbee and kickball. The old member mentors also found out who their new member mentees would be for the semester! </p>
