<h3><b>About Us</b></h3>
<p>One of Council's main goal is to continue improving upon the College and the Council itself. When members have issues or feedback, R&amp;D serves as the outlet to address grievances and provide solutions. The culture of R&amp;D and Council as a whole is such that conversation is encouraged and all opinions are heard. Moreover, the Committee has seen new growth in other avenues; as a product of R&amp;D, old-member projects, which hope to utilize the continuing members as resources, will cultivate legislation that hopes to make large impact on the College. One such legislation includes adding features to the registration that make the already stressful process more user friendly.
