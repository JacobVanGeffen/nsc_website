			<p>Academic Affairs (AA) seeks to connect students to resources in the CNS and help start conversations to catalyze change in the college. The committee  leads a variety of focus groups, awards scholarships for students, and presents student足nominated and student足selected awards for faculty members. Academic Affairs also works with the Career Design Center to help increase support for CNS majors trying to break into industry. Members have wide latitude when working in the committee. In the past, members have worked with other organizations to host speaker panels, develop legislation for CNS, and socialize the college, among other initiatives. Academic Affairs provides its members the opportunity to take charge of projects as well as develop ideas that will have lasting changes in CNS.</p>

			<h4>Medical School Panel</h4>
			<p>NSC hosted 4th year medical students from UTMB to answer questions from pre足med students about the application process and the medical school experience. The panel offered a relaxed environment in which students could ask those pesky questions that concern all pre足-meds. This very informative event will be back next year!</p>

			<h4>Grad School Panel</h4>
			<p>In the fall 2014, AA hosted graduate students from the Microbiology, Cell &amp; Molecular Biology, Neuroscience, Chemistry, and Physics departments to expose students to the graduate school experience and what it has to offer. They answered questions about their research interests, the application process, and their lifestyles as graduate students in Austin. Some of the graduate students candidly spoke about the decision process to apply to Ph.D. programs and the importance of picking an institution that catered to their interests.</p>
