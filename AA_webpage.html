<h3><b>About Us</b></h3>
<p>Academic Affairs (AA) seeks to connect students to resources in the CNS and help start conversations to catalyze change in the college. The committee  leads a variety of focus groups, awards scholarships for students, and presents student­nominated and student­selected awards for faculty members. Academic Affairs also works with the Career Design Center to help increase support for CNS majors trying to break into industry. Members have wide latitude when working in the committee. In the past, members have worked with other organizations to host speaker panels, develop legislation for CNS, and socialize the college, among other initiatives. Academic Affairs provides its members the opportunity to take charge of projects as well as develop ideas that will have lasting changes in CNS.</p>

			<h4>Medical School Panel</h4>
			<p>NSC hosted 4th year medical students from UTMB to answer questions from pre­med students about the application process and the medical school experience. The panel offered a relaxed environment in which students could ask those pesky questions that concern all pre­-meds. This very informative event will be back next year!</p>
